# vm_procsss_injection
idea is that it detects a VM and won't inject process with shell code. 
Still in Progress:

Needs to detect AMD and intel at runtime if detected it will run otherwise it will not run:

based from the following:

This will be added to:

Detect CPU at run time and continue to run:
else exit:

Then the process will be added to auto inject instead of manually doing it instead of user input
