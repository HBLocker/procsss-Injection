# vm_procsss_injection
idea is that it detects a VM and wont inject process with shell code. 
Still in Progress:

Needs to detect AMD and intel at runtime if detected it will run otherwise ti will not run:

based form the following:

This will be added to:

Detect CPU at run time and continue to run:
else exit:

Then the procsess will be added to to auto inject insted of manualy doing it insted of user input
